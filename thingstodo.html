			<p id="left_description">One of the busiest and most popular areas of Tokyo for foreigners and natives alike to travel to, Asakusa is a cultural hub of Tokyo.  It blends old with new, the main attraction is the Thunder Gate, the giant red gate and lantern shown in many travel blogs across the net.  While great for taking pictures of the lantern, there is a temple to see in the area, as well as a large market to get souvineers and seasonal foods and items.</p>

			<p id="left_description">A popular destination for tourists both sight seers and anime or gaming nerds alike is Akihabara.  This section of Tokyo is famous for its electronics, anime, gaming, and numerous maid cafes. If you want to check out the many figure shops with anime characters you can do that here, if you want to experience maid cafes there are plenty to choose from, the most fanous being 'Maidreamin'. This is not one of the cheaper places in Tokyo, but it is a one of a kind experience that you can only get here.</p>
